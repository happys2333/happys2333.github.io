This is my blog. I think that I will write a lot of things in the future. It mainly about some my experience in computer learning. It may have many fields because I like share my experience in all fields.

All in all, this blog's content will be various. But it mostly will be the experience for my in a period of time. Is there any about my life? Probably have. Most my blog will write both in English and Chinese. If I learn Japanese well in the future, maybe I will write in three different languages. Who knows.

I will add tag in every post in order to help you look up conveniently.
